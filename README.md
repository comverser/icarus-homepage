# Icarus Homepage

This repository contains a very small static website for the fictional company **Icarus**. The site lives in the `docs` directory so it can be served with GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `docs/index.html` – single-page site powered by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- `docs/style.css` – minimal styling for the page

## Running locally
Open `docs/index.html` in your browser.

To publish on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repository settings and choose the `docs` folder as the source.
