# Icarus Homepage

This repository hosts a small static website for the fictional company **Icarus**. All site files live in the repository root so GitHub Pages can serve them directly.

## Structure
- `index.html` â€“ single page built with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) from a CDN. Additional snippets (`contact-modal.html` and `contact-success.html`) are loaded dynamically via HTMX.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in your browser.

To publish on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repository settings and choose the root of the `main` branch as the source.
