# Icarus Homepage

This repository contains a very small static website for the fictional company **Icarus**. The site files live in the repository root so they can be served with GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `index.html` – single-page site powered by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- `style.css` – minimal styling for the page

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in your browser.

To publish on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repository settings and choose the root of the `main` branch as the source.
